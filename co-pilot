This /security directory contains SHA-256 hashes for each USWDS hashed release ZIP file. Use these hashes to verify the authenticity of USWDS release ZIP files. Compare our SHA-256 hash with the hash you generate from the ZIP you wish to test.

OSX/Linux: Use the sha256sum command in a terminal window. (Replace the path with the path to the file you wish to test.)

sha256sum path/to/filename.zip

Windows: Open up PowerShell and run the following command. (Replace the path with the path to the file you wish to test.)
